# Rorical Blue

**I did not actually learned php, pls don't scold me too much on my rubbish code.**

It's a Typecho theme with a bit of cute, which extended more here.

Theme originally created by [Rorical](https://github.com/Rorical)

## What I modified

- Fixed code for Typecho version 1.2 support.
- Changed main interface font to a cuter style, embedded in webpage.
- IP district display for comments following somewhere's network service regulation.
- Static site running time without any plugin. (Modifications may needed)
- Independent blog statistics in *about* page. (Independent page template)
- Whisper (personal posts) independent page. (Based on comments)

## Highlights

- Embedded code block highlight support and $\LaTeX$ formula support
